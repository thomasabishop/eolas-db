# Network fundamentals

> A network is a system that allows computing devices to communicate and
> exchange information with each other.

In order for devices to be able to communicate they must share a common
**communication protocol**.

A protocol specifies **rules determining how information is to be exchanged**.
(Simply connecting two devices is not sufficient for them to be able to
communicate, they must have a shared language.)

The nodes of a network are called [hosts](Network_hosts.md).
